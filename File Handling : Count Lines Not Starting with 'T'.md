## File  handeling in python: count lines Not 
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file `story.txt` that do **not** start with the alphabet `'T'`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Open the file `story.txt` in **read mode**.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is **not** `'T'`.
   - If the line does not start with `'T'`, increment the `count` by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the `count` value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with `'T'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```py
with open("story.txt","w")as f:
    f.write('This is muruga\n')
    f.write("This is the world\n")
    f.write("not permentent in this  world\n")
    f.write("This is the tamilnadu\n")
    f.write("kanthavela\n")
    f.write("world is biggest")
k=0
with open("story.txt",'r') as f:

    for i in f:
        if not i.startswith("T"):
            k+=1
print("count:",k)

```
