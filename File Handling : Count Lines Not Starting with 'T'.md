## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file `story.txt` that do **not** start with the alphabet `'T'`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Open the file `story.txt` in **read mode**.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is **not** `'T'`.
   - If the line does not start with `'T'`, increment the `count` by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the `count` value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with `'T'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```py
with open("story.txt","w")as f:
    f.write('This is muruga\n')
    f.write("This is the world\n")
    f.write("not permentent in this  world\n")
    f.write("This is the tamilnadu")

with open("story.txt",'r') as f:
    c=f.read()
    k=0
    for i in c:
        if i.startswith(("T")):
            k+=1
    print("count:",k)

```
