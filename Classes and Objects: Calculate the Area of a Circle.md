# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```py
import math
class cse:
    def mech(self):
        radius=int(input())
        c=math.pi*radius**2
        print(c)
muruga=cse()
muruga.mech()
```
